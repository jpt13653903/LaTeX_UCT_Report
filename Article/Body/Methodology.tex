\section{Methodology}

In this section you should describe the method of pursuing your investigation or experiment.

\subsection{Hardware}
Include detail such as the hardware used.  It's generally a good idea to include a block diagram at this point, such as the one presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:RS-232_Test}.  This figure was drawn in \href{http://www.inkscape.org/}{InkScape}~\cite{InkScape}.  When you want to import an InkScape figure (SVG format) into \LaTeX{}, simply save it to PDF (use the drawing extents as the media box area) and include the figure.

\Figure[scale=1.2]{Test setup used to test the implementation~\cite{Taylor_2016}.}{RS-232_Test}

\subsection{Implementation}
Also mention the implementation source code:

\begin{Matlab}
  # You can include inline Matlab / Octave code
  x = linspace(0, 2*pi, 1000);
  y = sin(x);
  plot(x, y); grid on;
\end{Matlab}

Or you could turn it into a float: see listing~\ref{lst:OpenCL_Matrix_Mult}.  Floats are tables, figures and listings that appear at a different place than in the source code.  This template is set up to put floats at the top of the next column, as prescribed by the IEEE article specification.

\begin{OpenCL_float}{OpenCL kernel to perform matrix multiplication}{OpenCL_Matrix_Mult}
  __kernel void Multiply(
    __global float* A, // Global input buffer
    __global float* B, // Global input buffer
    __global float* Y, // Global output buffer
      const  int    N  // Global uniform
  ){
    const int i = get_global_id(0); // 1st dimension index
    const int j = get_global_id(1); // 2nd dimension index
   
    // Private variables
    int   k;
    float f = 0.0;
   
    // Kernel body
    for(k = 0; k < N; k++) f += A[i*N + k] * B[k*N + j];
    Y[i*N + j] = f;
  }
\end{OpenCL_float}

Only list what is relevant.  Don't give too much detail - just enough to show what you've done.  This template supports the following languages:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Matlab (Octave)
  \item GLSL
  \item OpenCL
  \item Verilog
  \item VHDL
  \item TCL
  \item Python
  \item C++ (use the name `Cpp')
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experiment Procedure}
Furthermore, include detail relating to the experiment itself: what did you do, in what order was this done, why was this done, etc.  What are you trying to prove / disprove?  You can include hypotheses, such as presented in Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:Example} below.

\Hypothesis{Example}{All scientific papers contain hypotheses.  An hypothesis is generally not longer than a single paragraph, but the command does support multiple paragraphs if required.}
