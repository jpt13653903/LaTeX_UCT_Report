## General Workflow

If you'd like to make contributions to the project, the preferred method for 
the general public is to create a fork, make the changes and then
[create a pull request](https://github.com/jpt13653903/LaTeX_UCT_Report/pulls)
for that fork.  Project collaborators should create a branch, make changes and 
then [create a pull request](https://github.com/jpt13653903/LaTeX_UCT_Report/pulls) 
for that branch.
