\Chapter{First Appendix}

\todocard{
  You might want to have some overview text here explaining what is provided by this appendix and possibly how it is broken down into pieces. The appendix is ultimately supplementary material and additional supporting evidence for aspects of the main text body. Typically you don't need to be overly fussed about explaining its structure and layout, but the quality of the document can be enhanced by a short outline explaining the appendix at its beginning.

\section{Appendix Sections}

Using sections and subsections is highly recommended to help improve the structure and navigation of your appendix, and for providing links from the main body to specific entries in the appendix.
