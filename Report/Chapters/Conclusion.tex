\Chapter{Conclusion}
\label{Ch:Conclusion}

The conclusion should provide a summary of your findings.  Many people only read the introduction and conclusion of a paper.  They sometimes scan the tables and figures.  If the conclusion hints at interesting findings, only then will they bother to read the whole paper.

You can also include work that you intend to do in future, such as ideas for further improvements, or to make the solution more accessible to the general user-base, etc.
