\begin{abstract}
  The abstract should be a short summary of your dissertation.  It is meant to sell your thesis to interested buyers.
  
  {\color{red}This template includes advice relevant to a BSc final-year project (FYP), Masters dissertation or PhD thesis.  While it has some relevance to a much smaller report, such as a course project report or even a lab report, these smaller types of reports will have less pieces and do not need nearly as much detail and depth -- you are accordingly suggested to use the \textbf{Article} template in this repository; we will try to put together separate examples for a lab report and project report later.}
