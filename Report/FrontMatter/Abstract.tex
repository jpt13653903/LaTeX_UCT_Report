\begin{abstract}
  The abstract should be a one or two paragraph summary of your paper.  It is meant to sell your paper to interested buyers.
  
  {\color{red}This template includes advise relevant to a BSc final-year project (FYP), Masters dissertation or PhD thesis. While it has some relevant to a much smaller report, such as a course project report or even lab report, these smaller types of reports will have less pieces and do not need nearly as much detail and depth - you are accordingly suggested to view the \textbf{Article} structure in this repository; we will try to put together separate examples for a lab report and project report later.}
